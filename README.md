# Welcome to the old version of Authed

This was the first ever version of Authed.io, some of its code is still used today, but as I upgraded Authed to a brand new system I feel like I should open this repo.

If you'd like to contribute to it, go for it, I can get a subdomain up and we together can maintain a community version of Authed.io :)
